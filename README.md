== README

This is a personal website with a home, articles, projects and contact page.

The owner of the site can sign-in and add/update/delete articles and projects. 
I added functionality for markdown and coding syntax highlighting when 
adding/updating articles and projects. 

Many thanks to Mackenzie Child for this amazing tutorial.
